    Session 10A - Internet Fundamentals/Graphics and Multimedia
        Activity 1: W3Schools: Tryit Editor [Adding an image to HTML]
        In this activity, I learned that you can add images on your HTML folder. You could add all kinds of images, such as a .jpeg, .gif, and .png. All you have to do is to add the "img" tag, along with the "src", and the "alt" attributes, then the image will be accessible. [As I tried adding an image of my own to the "W3Schools Tryit" example, it wouldn't open it for me (it only takes certain images).]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for even more customization on future HTML assignments I create (if required). [Not only would I have a colorful background/ text, but I'll also add some images of my creations, or maybe some photos from the web.]
      Session 10B - Internet Fundamentals/Graphics and Multimedia
        Activity 1: W3Schools: Tryit Editor [Adding a video to HTML]
        In this activity, I learned that you can add videos in your folder. First, you need to embed the video link, copy it, and paste it to the HTML assignment. [Just click on the video I added below. Trust me, you won't regret it.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for adding video links to my assignments. If anybody ever wants to watch a tutorial or something, I could simply just embed the whole thing and paste the video involving the tutorial (or whatever anybody wants me to send them) below. Plus, I added audio. [I'm going to have so much fun when it comes to adding certain videos, and mysterious audio.]
