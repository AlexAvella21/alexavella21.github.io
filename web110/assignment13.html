    Session 13A - Database Management/Introduction
        Activity 1: Northwind [Solving questions]
        In this activity, I learned that the questions needed to be solved, and how I did that were by doing research on the Northwind section. [Each question told me what to do, and then I managed to solve each one (correctly, I hope...).]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for using Database in the future. [Depending on the subject.]
      Session 13B - Database Examples/Northwind
        Activity 1: Northwind [Customers, Products, Orders, OrderDetails, Suppliers, Shippers, and Employees]
        In this activity, I learned that the answers for each question were listed in the 7 fields I listed (in the activity name). [It was honestly quite a stretch for me to solve each problem, not to mention that there were some Math-related parts, which was fun.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for better strategies to solve these sorts of questions. [On pretty much anything regarding Database, Northwind is the answer.]
