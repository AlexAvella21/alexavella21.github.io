    Session 11A - Internet Fundamentals/Web Accessibility
        Activity 1: W3C: The W3C Markup Validation Service [Validating a URI, File, or Direct Input]
        In this activity, I learned that this website can help you validate your work by ensuring there aren't any errors. However, if you DO have an error, it'll tell you why it occurred and how to fix it. Make sure the border has no typo or any obsolete content. [For what I submitted to the validator, it told me the "frame border" was obsolete (last week's assignment file, to clarify. The frame border I added was the link to a YouTube video, and I'm guessing one thing obsolete about it is that there's no thumbnail showing up.), Hopefully, it isn't LITERALLY an error, but probably just the video's thumbnail they can't seem to validate.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for validating future assignments before officially submitting them to my instructor. [I'll fix whatever error my instructor points out as well.]
      Session 11B - Internet Fundamentals/Web Accessibility
        Activity 1: Paletton: The Color Scheme Designer [Adjusting the colors]
        In this activity, I learned that you could customize your color palette by adjusting the cursor to the desired color, and not only that, but you can also adjust them in Monochromatic, Adjacent, Triad, Tetrad, and even Freestyle mode. [Just adjust the hue, shading, and base RGB.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the palette I want once I need to use it for something. [Say, for example, I want to do some color corrections for a creation I make, and once I finish the adjustments, it'll turn out perfectly.]
