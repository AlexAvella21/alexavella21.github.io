    <h1>Assignment 4 - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 4A - Internet Fundamentals/Discussion Board
        Activity 1: Class Discussion: How does SMTP work? [did some research about how to use SMTP]
        In this activity, I learned that there's a tutorial of steps on how to create an SMTP server [I read the list of instructions on the website duocircle.com].
        In this activity, I will (probably) be able to apply for an SMTP server [I will add some thought into creating my own server, since it's my first time discovering it].
      Session 4B - Internet Fundamentals/Email
        Activity 1: E-mail Overview/Protocols/Working [went on tutorialspoint.com to read all about emailing]
        In this activity, I learned about some facts about Emails [I discovered different ways of sending an email (i.e., adding a CC/BCC, attachments, and blocking spam)].
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the BCC area of emailing [even though I already know about CC's, adding attachments, and getting rid of spam, I need to gain knowledge on BCC's].
