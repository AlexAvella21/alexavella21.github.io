    <h1>Assignment 4 - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 4A - Internet Fundamentals/Discussion Board
        Activity 1: Class Discussion: How does SMTP work? [did some research about how to use SMTP]
        In this activity, I learned that there's a tutorial of steps on how to create an SMTP server [I read the list of instructions on the website duocircle.com].
        In this activity, I will (probably) be able to apply for an SMTP server [I will add some thought into creating my own server, since it's my first time discovering it].
      Session 4B - Internet Fundamentals/Email
        Activity 1: E-mail Overview/Protocols/Working [went on tutorialspoint.com to read all about emailing]
        In this activity, I learned about some facts about Emails [I discovered different ways of sending an email (i.e., adding a CC/BCC, attachments, and blocking spam)].
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the BCC area of emailing [even though I already know about CC's, adding attachments, and getting rid of spam, I need to gain knowledge on BCC's].

    <h2>Assignment 4 - Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        This week, I learned about Emails, and a couple of activities I’ve done are SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server setup (which I haven’t done just yet, but will probably do so as long as it’s needed), read the listed activities (as listed in Wikiversity), and I’ve discovered a few interesting things about e-mailing. One thing I learned about this subject is CC/BCC’s in email composing. To describe, CC stands for Carbon Copy. According to tutorialspoint.com, It includes those recipient addresses whom we want to keep informed but not exactly the intended recipient, and BCC stands for Black Carbon Copy, and according to the same website as forementioned, It is used when we do not want one or more of the recipients to know that someone else was copied on the message. However, I want to learn how to use these two parts the next time I compose an email to somebody (just to get better with Gmail, so to speak). Though I already know how to add attachments, report spam emails, etc., One day, I’ll plan to become a professional with sending emails. Regardless, good week so far, and as the weeks go on, I’ll become twice the Internet geek I am today (hopefully…).
