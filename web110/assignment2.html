    <h1>Assignment 2 - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 2A - Internet Fundamentals/Introduction
        Activity 1: GitHub Student Development Pack Assignment [Fixing the Error Code 404 on GitHub account link]
        In this activity, I learned that I needed to make my account public in order to gain access to the typed-in link to my GitHub account. [Although it still failed, I'm still trying to get in the swing of things for becoming a skilled GitHub user, and at the same time, I still want a private account after setting that up.]
        In this activity, I be able to apply for the Student Development Pack for myself in my Github account. All I need to do is to (possibly) add billing information, that way it'll actually work.
      Session 2B - Internet Fundamentals/Web Browser
        Activity 1: 3 messages posted on different dates [1 comment, reply, and supportive recommendation]
        In this activity, I learned about web browser extensions, and I posted a comment on what they are and what they do. [I gave out a few examples of extensions, such as web locks, customizable mouse cursors, and ad-blocking services (which I fear I may've misphrased in terms of "extensions").]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply new features on the extensions and ensure they're safe for the web browser I typically use (which is Chrome) for myself on my laptop. I need to do research on Wikiversity to find what extensions I need for this course.
