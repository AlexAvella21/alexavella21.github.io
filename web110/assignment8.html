    <h1>Assignment 8 - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 8A - Internet Fundamentals/HTML
        Activity 1: W3Schools: Introduction to HTML [Gaining information on HTML/ seeing examples of it]
        In this activity, I learned that HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language", and is a standard language for creating Web pages + describes a structure for Web pages, it consists a series of elements, which tells the browser how to display the content, not to mention that they label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. [I'm CLEARLY using HTML on here as I type.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for typing HTML on future assignments (though I've done this since the beginning of the semester, it's smart to keep going until the end of the semester) I also tried a sample of running HTML and creating a heading/subheading. [Unless there are a few things I've never done on HTML before, I'd be honored to learn them.]
      Session 8B - Internet Fundamentals/HTML
        Activity 1: TutorialsPoint: HTML [Learning a bit more about HTML, discovering its origin and how it was evolved since then]
        In this activity, I learned that there were many different versions of HTML back in the day (from 1.0 to HTML5, 1991-2012). It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. [HTML was very unique to happen on the Web]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for extra information on HTML and learn to develop a webpage. [I'd develop a webpage for my cartoon creations, such as series I've created, concept art, and so much more.]
