    Session 14A - Database/SQL
        Activity 1: W3Schools: SQL Quiz [25-question SQL knowledge test]
        In this activity, I learned that SQL stands for "Structured Query Language", and also learned what each SQL statement is used for (i.e., What statement is used to update data = UPDATE), and how to select columns with certain names (example: How to select a column named "FirstName" from a table named "Persons" = SELECT FirstName FROM Persons). [At the beginning, I got 12-25 correct (48%), but as I took notes on each answer, I retook the quiz and got them all correct (100%).]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for whatever requires SQL, then I'll use my notes as reference. [Just in case anything I'm studying in the future requires Database entirely, then I'll take care of that.]
      Session 14B - Database/SQL
        Activity 1: W3Schools: Exercise v3.0 [SQL Exercises]
        In this activity, I learned that there are different kinds of columns to type in, depending on what it asks you to do (example: Select all records where the value of the City column starts with the letter "a". = SELECT * FROM Customers, WHERE City LIKE 'a%';). [I completed 21-52 exercises, not to mention just 6 whole columns, entirely.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for a job regarding Database. [With what I've learned crammed in my brain, doing SQL would seem easier for me.]  

<ul>SELECT * FROM Customers;</ul>
<ul>WHERE Country='USA';</ul>
<ul>SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Products;</ul>
<ul>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
    VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</ul>
<ul>UPDATE Customers
    SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1;</ul>
