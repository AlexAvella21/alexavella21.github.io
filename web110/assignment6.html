      Session 6A - Internet Fundamentals/Networking
        Activity 1: Internet Reference Models [reading about what types of reference models there are]
        In this activity, I learned that reference models offer means of standardization, and are acceptable worldwide. Reference models are important for people to learn how devices communicate. The two different types of reference models are OSI (Open System Interface), and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol). OSI is hypothetical, and the TCP/IP is practical. There's also an Application Layer (similar to the OSI model), and it provides different services. The protocols consist of TELNET, FTP, SMTP, DN, HTTP, and NNTP. [There are also plenty of other layers, and each of them have specific funtions.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the OSI and TCP/IP reference models. I should get to learn a little more about what they are, and why we should use them. [I'll look it up on my computer, and see if I need to put them to use, or unless I'm already using them right now (though I never noticed it).]
      Session 6B - Internet Fundamentals/Networking
        Activity 1: Internet Protocols [learning about protocols, different types of protocols, and differences between them]
        In this activity, I learned that the types of protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), and HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). [The difference between FTP and TFTP are that the operations are both transferring files, FTP has authentication, unlike the TFTP, FTP's protocol is TCP, and TFTP's protocol is UDP, FTP's ports are 21 - Control, 20 - Data, and TFTP's ports are Port 3214, 69, 4012, FTP and TFTP's Control and Data are both separated, and FTP's Data Transfer is reliable, while TFTP's Data Transfer is unreliable.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the FTP and TFTP's differences, and find out which protocol I should use more. [I believe both protocols need to be used for certain things, but all I need to do is gather a bit of information on what they should be used for and which should be used more frequently.]
