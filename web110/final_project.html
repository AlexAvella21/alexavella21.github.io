<p>Final Project Description</p>

What I've learned: 
1. Dragging/ dropping Multimedia files
2. Adding audio files
3. Adjusting the size of the media I’ve added
4. Creating a vector

How I added Media:
Firstly, I found an image (of my creation) from my files, then I copied the file name/ format, then I pasted it to my HTML assignment, and pasted <img src="The+Life+in+Riftwell+Poster.jpg" alt="The Life in Riftwell Poster" style="width:2550px;height:3300px;"> in order to make it pop up.
Secondly, I moved on to the audio segment. I searched up on the web for an MP3 file (of a soundtrack to my liking), and the next thing you know was that I downloaded it, then as I opened up my files, I copied the file name/ format, then pasted it to the HTML assignment (as in adding <audio controls>
    <source src="02_Reading_the_Letter.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>).
Thirdly, onto the video segment of this module, I went on YouTube and found a video, next thing I did was embed it, then pasted <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=k3q2vD8k0VGAWbwz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Why I enjoyed this topic:
To begin, I chose this topic because not only did I have a blast adding creations, audio, and videos to the assignment, but also because this topic involves one of my greatest strengths. I then made the decision to make Graphics and Multimedia the main capital of my final project presentation.

Next, from what I’ve learned out of it, I was able to add videos by embedding them, add audio by typing it in through HTML text to pop up, and dragging and dropping images (I also did the same thing with vector art that I made, in case I never mentioned that).

Lastly, I easily remember EXACTLY what I did in this assignment super well, and with this topic being easy for me to do (as my biggest strength), it was very fun, in fact, this was the sole purpose of why I chose to make a presentation about it.
