<p>Final Project Description</p>

In this course, I've learned a pretty decent amount about coding, and I managed to enjoy it thoroughly. My favorite part about this course was the "Graphics and Multimedia" topic, because this area involved one of my strong suits, Creations. I happened to enjoy this topic the most out of all the other topics, that I created a presentation regarding it (though the rest of the topics were good as well, I just lean a little more towards this topic in particular, according to my strengths). I can also say that although I've never been too much a professional with coding (heck, it was my first time learning about it), it was good to at least gain a bit of knowledge upon it. Good course, overall! Hopefully in my future, the knowledge I have for each topic I've learned this past semester will make an impact on the probability of getting my career.
