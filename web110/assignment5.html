    <h1>Assignment 5a - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 5A - Internet Fundamentals/Social Media (Facebook/Instagram)
        Activity 1: Facebook/Instagram tutorial [Getting to know the purpose of both the social networks]
        In this activity, I learned that Facebook is a website for posting status updates, photos, videos, and keeping in touch with family and friends, and Instagram is another program for posting (plus modifying) photos and videos, not to mention that I learned Facebook was originally designed for college students in 2004. [Facebook and Instagram (as of now) are both programmed by Meta, thus having similarities]
        In this activity, I already applied for both accounts (years ago, I created my own account for both these social networks, and I believe I know how to access everything through each app). Also, I learned that Web 2.0 are websites that emphasize user-generated content, usability, and interoperability for end users (https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Internet_Fundamentals/Social_Media, for citation, if needed).
      Session 5B - Internet Fundamentals/Social Media (Social Networking)
        Activity 1: TutorialsPoint - Social Networking [Knowing what it means and what you can do with it]
        In this activity, I learned that Social Networking is for grouping of individuals and organizations. [For sharing thoughts, interests, and activities]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for a new method of use of social networking (specifically for posting stuff related to my interests, and discussing about them (which could possibly establish a bond based off what we have in common)). 
    <h1>Assignment 5b - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 5A - Internet Fundamentals/Communications (Internet Services)
        Activity 1: TutorialsPoint - Internet Services [Learning about Internet/Communication services and how they work]
        In this activity, I learned that Internet Services associate with Communication services, Information retrieval services, Web services, and the World Wide Web (WWW). [There's a diagram of all 4 of these services linked with Internet Services on the website itself]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for more knowledge on these sorts of services (just in case I need to use one I never learned before, this'll be the right time to learn about that service).
      Session 5B - Internet Fundamentals/Communications (Snapchat)
        Activity 1: Snapchat tutorial [Learning about its main purpose and how it originated]
        In this activity, I learned that Snapchat was specifically designed for smartphones, and is famous for its time-limited photos and videos (plus stories), and filters. [Snapchat is unique for its snapshots and interactions all combined in one app, and it has several cool features]
        In this activity, I already applied for Snapchat, and have moderate experience with it (except the fact that I don't have Snapchat Premium, in which case I don't think I need).
