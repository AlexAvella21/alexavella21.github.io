      Session 5A - Internet Fundamentals/JavaScript
        Activity 1: W3Schools: JavaScript Introduction [Adding an HTML Attribute]
        In this activity, I learned that JavaScript is a programming language, and it can give out little hidden surprises (for example, if there's a button that says "Click Me!", you'll do as it instructs and it'll unfold and a message will pop up). Text manipulation, so to speak. It can also make effects (i.e., the Light Bulb switch part of this website). JavaScript is also useful in games, audio, and media. [I'm new to this activity, so it may take me a bit of time to get the swing of using JavaScript for certain things.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for creating anything to my desire with Java-based features, and I'll put text manipulation to good use. [As long as I learn more about how to use it, I'll know what to add.]

        Activity 2: TutorialsPoint: JavaScript Tutorial [Reading the information regarding JavaScript]
        In this activity, I learned that a few facts on JavaScript are that it's a lightweight, interpreted programming language, has object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages, and the general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers. Plus, it helps you develop front-end and back-end software once you get the hang of using JavaScript, and can help you create fancy websites. [Personally, I always thought JavaScript was only used for particular, yet obscure things.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for stronger knowledge upon JavaScript, since it's a very important part of the internet/ coding. [I just need to know if there's something else to add in JavaScript HTML, because I've already got 1 down (as shown below).]
