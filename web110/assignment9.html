      Session 9A - Internet Fundamentals/CSS
        Activity 1: W3Schools: Tryit Editor [Creating Internal CSS]
        In this activity, I learned that Internal CSS can stylize your background, text, font size, etc. If you type in a color (i.e., background color, text color, and margin adjustments), it'll appear in the form of your preference. [Your background will appear as the color you typed in, and the fonts will appear in your preferred color/size, plus your margins will appear in the position you set it to.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for customization on my future assignment htmls. [I may make each assignment a different color, but I will keep the fonts the same size/position.]
      Session 9B - Internet Fundamentals/CSS
        Activity 1: W3Schools: Tryit Editor [Creating Inline CSS]
        In this activity, I learned that Inline CSS can only stylize text. It's probably the same thing as Internal, except there's no background adjustment. [Unless there's something I don't get in this area, I should perhaps investigate a difference.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for this technique in every assignment I create. [As long as I discover a difference between this and Internal CSS, I'll know what to do in this field.]
