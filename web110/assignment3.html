    <h1>Assignment 3 - Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Session 3A - Internet Fundamentals/Discussion Board
        Activity 1: Class Discussion: Case Study Scenario [Posting an answer to the case study questions]
        In this activity, I learned that Ellen needed to trust the author's credentials and cite her sources before her presentation [I came up with a few solutions on what she should do correctly if she's going to present].
        In this activity, I be able to apply for the next presentation I'd possibly make [I will cite any source I use for information, and ensure the author provides official information].
      Session 3B - Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines
        Activity 1: Search Engines Flash Cards
        In this activity, I learned about some facts about Search Engines [I found a link to Quizlet, and it made a perfect source of gathering information about Search Engines]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the 3rd quiz with all of this knowledge [I'll be reading more flash cards prior to the end of January, thus gaining even more knowledge].
