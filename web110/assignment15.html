    Session 15A - Project Management [Creating Task Chart]
        Activity 1: Microsoft Excel [Listing tasks]
        In this activity, I learned that once you create a task chart in Excel, you'll have a list of tasks to do in advance of the time you begin working on your final project presentation. [I listed what was listed on the BlackBoard instructions, and hopefully I did every step correctly...]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for my final project presentation. With everything written down, I'll have no issue working on the presentation on PowerPoint. [In the future, I'm assuming, task charts could be very helpful for preperation of presentations.]
      Session 15B - Project Management [Developing Final Project Presentation]
        Activity 1: Microsoft PowerPoint [Creating the Presentation]
        In this activity, I learned that the topic I chose, Graphics and Multimedia has been a fun topic to learn about. I chose this because I'm actually GREAT at this sort of stuff. [Media is very fun when it comes to adding them to your assignment HTML's, so others can see them.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for making more effective PowerPoint presentations in the future once required. [Though I've used PowerPoint before, it'll help me get in the swing of things the more I use it. Hopefully, this presentation turns out well.]


<p>Final Project Description</p>

What I've learned: 
1. Dragging/ dropping Multimedia files
2. Adding audio files
3. Adjusting the size of the media I’ve added
4. Creating a vector

How I added Media:
Firstly, I found an image (of my creation) from my files, then I copied the file name/ format, then I pasted it to my HTML assignment, and pasted <img src="The+Life+in+Riftwell+Poster.jpg" alt="The Life in Riftwell Poster" style="width:2550px;height:3300px;"> in order to make it pop up.
Secondly, I moved on to the audio segment. I searched up on the web for an MP3 file (of a soundtrack to my liking), and the next thing you know was that I downloaded it, then as I opened up my files, I copied the file name/ format, then pasted it to the HTML assignment (as in adding <audio controls>
    <source src="02_Reading_the_Letter.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>).
Thirdly, onto the video segment of this module, I went on YouTube and found a video, next thing I did was embed it, then pasted <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=k3q2vD8k0VGAWbwz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Why I enjoyed this topic:
To begin, I chose this topic because not only did I have a blast adding creations, audio, and videos to the assignment, but also because this topic involves one of my greatest strengths. I then made the decision to make Graphics and Multimedia the main capital of my final project presentation.

Next, from what I’ve learned out of it, I was able to add videos by embedding them, add audio by typing it in through HTML text to pop up, and dragging and dropping images (I also did the same thing with vector art that I made, in case I never mentioned that).

Lastly, I easily remember EXACTLY what I did in this assignment super well, and with this topic being easy for me to do (as my biggest strength), it was very fun, in fact, this was the sole purpose of why I chose to make a presentation about it.


<p>My Gantt Chart. The other tasks (as listed in Blue and Red) will be done on upcoming days prior to the whole project presentation's due date.</p>
