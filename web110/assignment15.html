    Session 15A - Project Management [Creating Task Chart]
        Activity 1: Microsoft Excel [Listing tasks]
        In this activity, I learned that once you create a task chart in Excel, you'll have a list of tasks to do in advance of the time you begin working on your final project presentation. [I listed what was listed on the BlackBoard instructions, and hopefully I did every step correctly...]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for my final project presentation. With everything written down, I'll have no issue working on the presentation on PowerPoint. [In the future, I'm assuming, task charts could be very helpful for preperation of presentations.]
      Session 15B - Project Management [Developing Final Project Presentation]
        Activity 1: Microsoft PowerPoint [Creating the Presentation]
        In this activity, I learned that the topic I chose, Graphics and Multimedia has been a fun topic to learn about. I chose this because I'm actually GREAT at this sort of stuff. [Media is very fun when it comes to adding them to your assignment HTML's, so others can see them.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for making more effective PowerPoint presentations in the future once required. [Though I've used PowerPoint before, it'll help me get in the swing of things the more I use it. Hopefully, this presentation turns out well.]
        
<p>My Gantt Chart. The other tasks (as listed in Blue and Red) will be done on upcoming days prior to the whole project presentation's due date.</p>
