      Session 7A - Internet Fundamentals/Security
        Activity 1: GCFLearnFree - Internet Safety [watching all 5 videos related to this subject on YouTube]
        In this activity, I learned that in the Browser Features (video #1), it tells you about the domain name and ensuring it's the right, trusted kind, and there could be another site domain similar to it (a phony version). Despite it looking professional, it's really unsafe, and will contain malware. You also need to ensure you have the latest version of Chrome. Spam and phishing (video #2) are both important to understand, and are harmful to other users. Spammers can send emails to several people at once, and may not be the best idea (be cautious at this point). Phishers (trusted sources in disguise, as I'd like to call them) can send others links that look important, but are actually risky towards them, and they'll likely steal your personal information. Online shopping (video #3) lets you know that if you do this action, it's best to do it at home (and on YOUR computer). Many shopping websites have either a good or bad reputation, and Amazon and eBay are the #1 trustworthy shopping media. However, if you're using another shopping website, it's probably smart for you to do a little research upon it, and check its reviews/ratings prior to using that online store. Digital tracking (video #4) is another part of Internet Safety for you to know. This topic explains the data it tracks from videos that you've previously watched, and you'll see ads relevant to them. How that happens is when you allow "tracking cookies", it'll contain those certain ads on every website you use (and on any device you own, as long as you're using the same account you used on the first device you saw it on). This topic is part of the "Modern Online Reality". Facebook Privacy (video #5) explains that there are pros and cons on the privacy of this social media. 6 different kinds of social circles on there are Friends (a naturally secure field, along with Lists), Friends of Friends (a least secure field), Public (an even least secure field), Only Me (a very secure field), and Custom (to your preference). [The last field really inspired me to keep my account's content between just me and my close contacts.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for the tips provided in the videos that I've watched. [This'll lead me to becoming better with protecting my identity.]
      Session 7B - Internet Fundamentals/Security
        Activity 1: TutorialsPoint - Internet Security/ Data Encryption [doing research and gathering information on both topics.]
        In this activity, I learned that Internet Security is helpful for securing communication across the internet. It contains IPSec (Internet Security Protocol) and SSL (Secure Socket Layer). IPSec consists of a set of protocols designed by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), and provides security at network level and helps create authenticated and confidential IP layer packets. SSL is a security protocol developed by NCC (Netscape Communications Corporation), it provides security at a transport layer, and addresses the following security issues, such as privacy, integrity, and authentication. Next topic, Encryption is a method of security, and it contains messages written in scrambled letters (also called "Ciphertext"). There are two different types of encryption called Symmetric Key Encryption, and Public Key Encryption. Symmetric algorithm uses the same cryptographic keys for both encryption and decryption of ciphertext. Public algorithm, on the other hand, uses pairs of keys, with one being a secret, and the other being a public key. Surprisingly, both keys are mathematically linked with each other. [Ciphertext may take a maximum of over 200 years to solve, depending upon the text length.]
        In this activity, I will be able to apply for solving ciphertext messages by decrypting it. [To be honest, I sort of find solving secrets fascinating, and next time I stumble upon ciphertext, I can try decrypting it to discover what the message says in plain text.]
